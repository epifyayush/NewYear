`Happy New Year.

I hope this year is gentle with you — in ways you don’t have to explain to anyone. I hope you find moments that feel like quiet wins, and days that don’t ask too much of you.

The website wasn’t meant to be anything important. You didn’t ask for it, and it wasn’t necessary. It was just my way of wishing you, a little differently. I enjoyed making it — genuinely. Somewhere along the way it became something else, not exactly what I planned, but that’s on me. I’m still learning.

There’s no expectation tied to it. No meaning you need to carry forward.

I don’t want anything from you — not explanations, not reassurance. Just one small thing, if you’re okay with it. Your promise that you’ll still be here when the next New Year comes around. That’s all.

However this year unfolds, I hope it’s kind to you.

Take care...

And a VERY HAPPY NEW YEAR 2026 NABANITA...
